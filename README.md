# CSP Brush Info

CSP Brush Info is a C# Windows application that reads Clip Studio Paint brush configurations and displays them in a readable form. It can also compare two brushes and show the differences. This can be useful for seeing the structure of the brush parameters and to easily compare the differences between two brushes. It is easier to compare brushes this way than by hunting through the brush properties dialog in Clip Studio Paint, and it may give you some insight into how Clip Studio Paint brushes are configured.
